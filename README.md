# Marketing-ad-campaign-experimentation-

# Business problem:
In the fast-paced world of marketing, companies are on a constant quest to launch campaigns that truly resonate with their audience. However, with the market's complexity and the multitude of options available, identifying the most effective strategy can be like searching for a needle in a haystack. 

Hence, as a product data scientist at a leading marketing firm, goal is to meticulously design, execute, and analyze an A/B experiment that pits a traditional product advertisement against a Public Service Announcement (PSA). The PSA serves as our control group, representing the baseline, while the product advertisement is the treatment we're testing for its potential to enhance user conversion.

# Objective:

Before rolling out the change, the team would be more comfortable testing it on a small number of users to see how it performs, so you suggest running an A/B test on a subset of your user base users.
